                <h1 class="post-title">Moby-Dick; or, The Whale</h1>
                <h2 class="post-author">Herman Melville</h2>
                <p class="post-content">Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.</p>

                <h1 class="post-title">Grief</h1>
                <h2 class="post-author">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</h2>
                <p class="post-content">I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;<br/>That only men incredulous of despair,<br/>Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air<br/>Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access<br/> Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,<br/>In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare<br/>Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare<br/>Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express<br/>Grief for thy dead in silence like to death—<br/>Most like a monumental statue set<br/>In everlasting watch and moveless woe<br/>Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.<br/>Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:<br/>If it could weep, it could arise and go.<br/></p>

                <h1 class="post-title">Jane Eyre</h1>
                <h2 class="post-author">Charlotte Bronte</h2>
                <p class="post-content">Women are supposed to be very calm generally:  but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.</p>
